> [!WARNING] 
> Mother is in beta development. I'm on a quest to reduce the character count, and increase the functionality. Please report any issues you encounter, and expect some of the commands and underlying framework to change.
 

Mother is a general purpose operating system for Space Engineers grids available as an in-game script. It exposes an intuitive command line interface (CLI), flexible flight control & planning, and an intergrid communication system to massively expand what you can do with your grid(s). I built Mother to make my ships operate more like spaceships on a network, rather than just a collection of blocks flying through space. With Mother's CLI, most common operations can easily be assigned to a button without needing a Timer or Event Block. 

You do not need any programming experience to use Mother.  In fact, most of Mother's CLI commands offer a more intutive control mechanism than the base game itself. However, if you fancy yourself a programmer, you can easily extend Mother's functionality by creating a custom project. Mother is built on top of [MDK-SE](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE), thanks to the incredible contributions **Malware** has made to the Space Engineers community.  I hope you enjoy using Mother as much as I enjoyed building it.

The empire must grow.
