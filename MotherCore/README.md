Mother Core is a framework that acts as a foundation to Space Engineers programmable block scripts.  Building custom scripts on top of Mother Core is designed to be simple and intutive for both new and expert script developers.  It simplifies intergrid communication, navigation, block automation, and event monitoring. Should players chose, they can use Mother Core to run most automations on their grid without the need for an Event Controller or Timer Block.

Any grid running an instance of Mother Core will cooperate, greatly expanding what players can do with multiple grids. [Mother OS](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3411507973) was built as the first of several Mother-powered scripts in development to address several dimensions of the Space Engineers gameplay experience.

You will need a basic knowledge of programming to get the most out of Mother Core. However, I was highly motivated to build Mother to reduce the barrier of entry for players to begin writing their own scripts.  Mother exists so that programmable blocks become easier to work with.

The empire must grow.

> [!CAUTION] 
> Mother Core should never be modified directly in your project folder.
## Dependencies

Like most Space Engineers scripts, Mother Core requires [MDK2](https://github.com/malforge/mdk2) to enable a rich development experience. A big thanks to **Malware** for their incredible contributions to the Space Engineers community.

##  About Agentluke
I have always been passionate about aviation and space. I studied Aerospace Engineering, and flew in fighter jets in the Air Force for over a decade. I have been writing software since university, and I have always been fascinated by the intersection of software and hardware.

I discovered Space Engineers several years ago after my brother had been playing it for some time. I was immediately hooked. Sandbox games and builders are my jam, and Space Engineers is an excellent space sandbox. I find the automation capabilties quite clunky and require a lot of menu navigation, but curiousity got the best of me as I explored what the programmable block could do!  

I built Mother to make my ships operate more like intelligent spaceships, rather than just a collection of blocks flying through space. This project has been a labor of love for about 18 months. I hope you enjoy using Mother as much as I enjoyed building it.
