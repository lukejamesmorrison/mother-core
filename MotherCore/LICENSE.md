# Mother Core – Usage & Licensing Guidelines

Mother Core is an open-source framework for developing programmable block scripts in Space Engineers. It is licensed under the [MIT License](#mit-license), with the following additional usage requirement:

## Permitted Uses

- **Build and distribute your own scripts** that use Mother Core as a foundation.
- **Modify and extend** the framework to suit your project needs.
- **Reference the codebase** for educational or development purposes.

## Attribution Requirement

Any script using Mother Core should include clear visible credit in its Steam Workshop, Mod.io, or other marketplace description:

> **Powered by Mother**

This acknowledgment ensures transparency and supports the open-source ecosystem. Plus, if a player knows your scripts runs with Mother Core, then they know it will work their other Mother-powered scripts. Win-win.
